# Loyalty Customer - Login & Register Pages

A clean and responsive set of authentication pages extracted from the larger project **Loyalty Customer Management System**, built in **2018** using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **jQuery** with a fully custom UI design.

## 🔐 Overview
This is a lightweight subset of the full loyalty customer system, focusing only on the **login** and **shop registration** pages. It includes modern UI components and is fully responsive for all screen sizes.

The design was originally based on Photoshop mockups and hand-coded without using any CSS frameworks.

## 📋 Pages Included
- `login.html` – User login page
- `register-shop.html` – Shop registration form

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Semantic markup and accessibility
- **CSS3** – Responsive layout, animations, Flexbox/Grid
- **jQuery** – Dynamic interactions and form effects

> ⚠️ Note: This project was originally developed in **2018**, so JavaScript/jQuery files may require updates to avoid conflicts with modern practices.
